# React Developer Tools

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand how to use the dev tools to debug code in lieu of console.log
-   Understand the potential use cases for using the dev tools (components)

## How, and why, we use the dev tools?

All pages will be ready for you to navigate through the nav bar buttons, you will be met with a bug or two for each one and will show the students how to debug the issue using the react dev tools.

Ask the students how they might want to debug these if we had no knowledge of Dev Tools. Try to console log the issues and make a point to show the issue of console.log being syncronous vs setState functions being asynchronous. (we get the console log of the previous state)

Goto the chrome extension page to show how we install the dev tools. We will only be using the components tab for the students but feel free to mention that the Profiler tab is really just for optimising your front end code to load quicker and wont be much use for us at this stage.

Use this app if you need a quick lesson on some of the feature of dev tools.

Here is a short video that will highlight some of the more useful features to also talk about

The features i would focus on are;

-   Element Selector tool - you can use the html element browser tool to draw parallels
-   Navigating props, state, and context and how we can use them to understand what our app is doing right now.
-   Editing props, state, and context to show how we can debug in the browser, similar to how we can edit CSS in the browser.
